# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven Hunt.

## Work

I'm currently working at [Defra](https://github.com/defra) :earth_africa:
:tractor: as a Lead Developer. I've previously worked at
[NHS.UK](https://github.com/nhsuk), mostly on projects helping people
[find services](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search) :hospital:.

## Code

I typically code in
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and I
enjoy learning new languages. Most recently I've been dabbling in
[Go](https://golang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is my go to practice tool and I thoroughly
enjoy challenges such as [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Game

Of late, I've developed a keen interest in game development using
[GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) and
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (Godot being my current preference due to the
open source nature of the development and licensing).

## Blog

Although I have a long list of blog posts to write I rarely (never) prioritise
them over other activities hence the current state of the
[last post being from 2016](https://st3v3nhunt.github.io/) :sob:. A similar
story with my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/st3v3nhunt) :black_circle:
