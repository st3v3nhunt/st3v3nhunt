# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steve Hunt.

## Work

I'm currently working at [Made Tech](https://github.com/madetech) as a
[Lead Software Engineer](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/roles/lead_software_engineer.md).
Before I joined Made Tech I was working at [Defra](https://github.com/defra)
:earth_africa: :tractor: as a Lead Developer. And before that I worked at
[NHS.UK](https://github.com/nhsuk), mostly on projects helping people
[find services](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search) :hospital:.

## Code

Over the years I've written a lot of
[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and more recently
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
I enjoy learning new languages and dip in and out of experimenting with
[Go](https://golang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is my go to practice tool and I enjoy taking
part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Blog

I infrequently blog at [blog.st3v3nhunt.me](https://blog.st3v3nhunt.me/) with
sporadic bursts of activity!
